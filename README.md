# pandas-notes
# how pandas differ from numpy
pandas:
pandas is defined as an open source library that provides high performance data manipulation in python .it is built on the numpy package,which means numpy is required for operating the pandas.the name os pandas is derived from the word panel data,which means an econometrics from multidimentional data.it is used for data analysis in python and develeoped by wes mckinney in 2008

numpy
But compared to numpy it is mostly based on the c language,and it is an extension module of python.it is defined as a python package used for performibng the various numerical computtations and processing of thre multidimentional and sinflr-dimentional array elements .the calciulations using numpy arrays are faster then the norml python array.

the numpy pacakage is created by travis oliphant in 2005 by adding the functionalitis of the ancestors module numeric into another modulr numarray.

difference
1.the pandas module mainely works with the tabular data,where as the numpy module works with the numerical data

2.the pandas provides some sets of powerful toools like dataframe and series that mainely used for analyzing the data where as in numpy

3.the performance of numpy is better than numpy for 50k rows or less

4.the performance of pandas is better than numpy for 500k rows or more

5.numpy haa less memory than pandas

1. pandas features
1.1 handling of data:
pandas library provides a really fast and efficient way to manage and explore data.it does that by providing us with series and dataframes,which are explore data.it does that by providing us with series and data frames,which help us not only the represent data efficiency but also manulpiate it in various ways.these features of pandas is exectly what makes it such an attractive library for data scientists

1.2 alignment and indexing:
having adat is useles if you dont know where it belongs and what it tells us aboout so,labelelling of data is very imp and indexing

1.3 handeling missing data
missing data can be ghandeleld very well in pandas

1.4 cleaning up data
it is very imp that we clean data up

1.5 input and output tools
inputing and outputiing data is very imp,just like we can asscess jason file,note file ,c file etc...any typr of file

1.6 multiple file formats supports
we can access various file formats

1.7 merging and jooining of datasets
1.8 a lot of time series
1.9 optimized performance
1.10 python support
1.11 visualize
1.12 grouping
1.13 mask data: (hiding data)
1.14 unique data
1.15 perform mathematical operations of data
